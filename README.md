# Script
Scripts for sveral different computer languages (Perl, R, bash etc.) by me or others will be put here. Object-oriented ideas will be realized in the production and organization, for efficient code re-use and search. The scripts should mainly include those for tasks and pipelines, usually, the pipeline should be made with bash, and tasks made with Perl, R, Python.
